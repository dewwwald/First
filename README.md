#Modern

##A few points
- Because when you want to go fast you must go alone. I am still learning and this will be a way to refine my workflow (If you want to learn you must go alone)
- Bootstrap, Foundation, Topcoat is good but not great. I believe it could be better.
- SCSS frameworks make it easy to start a project visually. However I believe there are more maintainable approaches.
- This is a framework for toolkit development. Add things as you need them.

##Knowledge and resources
- You should learn css (or some other tech that will displace it) not a framework like this. So first go learn that and come back. For if css goes far enough and browsers catch on sass could become obsolete.
- Read the framework.
- This framework is as a result of github.com/larrybotha/styleguide, whom use to be my mentor in css
- Inuit.css is a good to idea of what this framework should do.

##INSTALLATION

Run the following command in the folder you want the framework to be made.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/dewwwald/Modern/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zx --strip 1
```

##TERMS

- For example a grid-width arranged with a grid wrap is dependant on one another.
